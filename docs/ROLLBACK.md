# Rollback Procedures for LLM-Alert-Enrichment

This guide describes how to safely revert your deployment to a previous stable state in case of failure or issues.

---

## 1. Version Control Revert
- Use git to restore the last known good commit or branch.
- Example:
  ```sh
  git checkout main
  git reset --hard <last-known-good-commit>
  git push --force origin main
  ```

## 2. Restore Environment Configuration
- Revert `.env` or config files to their previous versions (keep backups before changes).
- Example:
  ```sh
  cp .env.backup .env
  ```

## 3. Re-deploy Application
- Restart services using the previous codebase.
- Example:
  ```sh
  # If using Docker (when available)
  docker compose down
  docker compose up -d
  
  # If running directly with Python
  # Stop current process (Ctrl+C) and restart:
  uvicorn src.api.server:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
  
  # If using systemd service
  systemctl restart <your-service>
  ```

## 4. Restore Data (if needed)
- Restore Elasticsearch or database snapshots if data was affected.
- Example:
  ```sh
  # Elasticsearch snapshot restore
  curl -X POST "localhost:9200/_snapshot/my_backup/snapshot_1/_restore"
  ```

## 5. Verify Rollback
- Test the system to ensure itâ€™s functioning as expected.
- Check logs, run test scripts, and confirm dashboard/UI is correct.

## 6. Document Incident
- Record what was rolled back, why, and any lessons learned for future deployments.

**Tip:** Always keep backups of critical files and data before making major changes or deployments.
