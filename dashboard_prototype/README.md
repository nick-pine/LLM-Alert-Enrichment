# Dashboard Widget Prototype

This folder contains code and technical plans for prototyping dashboard widgets and chat/assistant features for LLM-Alert-Enrichment. This folder is currently ignored from production builds.

## Goals
- Create UI mock-ups and sample code for:
  - "Smart Summary" collapsible panel for enriched alerts
  - Visual confidence badge
  - Tag-cloud style chip display
  - Chat/assistant widget for LLM-powered Q&A
- Provide technical integration plans for OpenSearch Assistant or custom UI

## Next Steps
- Review `widget_mockup.jsx` and `chat_assistant.jsx` for sample React components
- See `integration_plan.md` for technical steps to integrate with OpenSearch Assistant or build a custom dashboard
